# The Blog

This application is a pretty straightforward blog format and setup. We're using the platform in our case for tech news and updates through way of a blog. This application has a user sign-in and sign-out whereby registered users can log into their account and comment on other people's posts. Non-users may read the posts but they will not be able to comment on them.

## Usage 

### Front-End

Head on to [The Blog](https://polar-spire-98498.herokuapp.com/) and sign up for an account in order to comment on other people's post. When you visit the site for the first time, you will be presented with the homepage which includes existing blog posts if any have been posted; navigation links for the homepage and the dashboard; and the option to log in.

When you click on an existing blog post you will be presented with the post title, contents, post creator’s username, and date created for that post and have the option to leave a comment. You may enter a comment and click on the submit button while signed in, the comment will then be saved and the post  updated to display the comment, the comment creator’s username, and the date created.

Clicking on the dashboard option in the navigation takes you to the dashboard where you will be presented with blog posts already created and the option to add a new blog post. Clicking on one of the existing posts in the dashboard will allow you to delete or update your post and take you back to an updated dashboard.
